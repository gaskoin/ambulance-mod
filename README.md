# Ambulance Modification
This is modification for my daughters non digital Revell ambulance toy. I simply wanted to add buzzer with two diodes and a trigger button to make it flash and sound like a real ambulance!

It is build on MSP430 microcontroller for extra ordinary battery lifetime. It will basically last forever.

Operation is very easy. You just press the button and make your ambulance sound and flash for a while.
