I simply wanted to add buzzer with two diodes and a trigger button to make it flash and sound like a real ambulance!

Operation is very easy. You just press the button and make your ambulance sound and flash for a while.

It is build on MSP430 microcontroller for extra ordinary battery lifetime. It will basically last forever. To launch the project you need to install [Code Composer](https://www.ti.com/tool/CCSTUDIO) from TI.
